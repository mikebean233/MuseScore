MuseScore Version 3 design goals/changes
====================================================================

- Optimize horizontal layout by allowing overlapping segments.
      - Compute an outline (shape) for every Staff/Segment.
      - Use the outline to compute the minimum distance between Segments.
            - this also avoids collisions between Lyrics and ChordNames

- Automatically increase vertical space between staves to avoid collisions.
      - Use the segment shapes to compute the minimum distance between staves.

- Do not allow more than one System on a line. In 2.x a horizontal box splits
  a line into two systems. In 3.x a horizontal box is handled as a special measure.
  This simplifies layouting a page a lot.

- System bar lines are moved into measures in a special segment type "BeginBarLine".

- Consider handling Instrument names as special HBox. This may remove some
  special case handling from layout().

- Do not undo/redo add/removal of "created" elements.
      - It speeds up doLayout() and consumes less memory.

      ? This should allow to call doLayout() outside of a command.
            * not possible as user modified elements like precaution symbols
              and system headers may be modified.

      ? layout of parts after change in one part not necessary

      - incomplete layouts should be possible (layout only up to first page
        to speed up program start)

      In 2.x all Segments must be on the undo/redo stack to keep the history
      consistent, This was necessary as Segments were referring to
      previous/next segments to find the proper insertion point.

      In 3.x  Undo knows were to (re-)insert them by only checking type and tick
      position.
